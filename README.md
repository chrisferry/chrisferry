#### ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve built platforms that handle billions in transactions, led distributed teams across time zones, and still enjoy getting my hands dirty in Terraform modules. When I’m not deep in infra or code, I’m usually traveling, mountain biking, or reading sci-fi and fantasy somewhere quiet.
